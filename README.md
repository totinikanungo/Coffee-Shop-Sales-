## **COFFEE SHOP SALES ANALYSIS**

## **Project Overview**
This project is an in-depth sales analysis of a coffee shop, leveraging Microsoft Excel to uncover valuable business insights. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and after rigorous data cleaning in Power Query Editor, I created interactive dashboards, pivot tables, and custom measures to provide a comprehensive view of sales trends and customer behavior.

## **OBJECTIVE**
The primary goal of this project is to analyze retail sales data to gain actionable insights that can help enhance the performance of the coffee shop.

## **KEY ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS ANSWERED:**
- How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
